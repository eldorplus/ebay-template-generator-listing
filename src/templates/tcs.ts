They want a future they can look forward to and we&apos;re here to make sure they get it. Working alongside young people, their families and community, we will not rest until together, step-by-step, we&apos;ve created a society built for all children.</p><p>Young people come to us when they have low self-esteem. When they&apos;re living in families who can&apos;t afford the next meal, the next size up in school uniform. Or when there&apos;s no one else to lean on.</p><p>Refugee and migrant children land in this country alone and look to us for guidance to achieve the life they dreamed of. To have a settled home, a secure job and starting a family. They&apos;re not asking for too much.</p><p>We see teenagers in our services who want to quit using drugs or alcohol. Who are looking after mum, dad, or their siblings more than they bargained for. Or who have been taken advantage of and find themselves carrying drugs to far away towns. Often, the hope inside them has taken a battering, it might only be hanging by a thread. But we know it&apos;s there. And we see a better future is within reach.</p></aside></article></main></div><div id="footer-container"><footer class="wrapper" role="contentinfo"><small>&copy; The Children&apos;s Society</small></footer></div>`;
